ASL Sign Bridge Real-Time American Sign Language Recognition System

📌 Abstract ASL Sign Bridge is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system designed to bridge the communication gap between deaf/mute individuals and non-sign language users. The system uses a webcam to capture hand gestures, processes them using computer vision and deep learning techniques, and converts the recognized signs into readable text or speech. The project also supports speech-to-sign and sign-to-speech translation, enabling two-way communication.

🎯 Problem Statement People who rely on sign language often face communication barriers when interacting with individuals who do not understand sign language. Existing solutions are limited, expensive, or not accessible in real time. This project aims to provide an affordable, real-time, and user-friendly solution that translates American Sign Language gestures into text and speech using a web-based system.

💡 Proposed Solution ASL Sign Bridge uses a webcam-based interface combined with machine learning models to detect and classify hand gestures. The recognized gestures are mapped to corresponding letters or words and displayed as text. Additional modules allow conversion between speech and sign language, making the system versatile and inclusive.

📊 Dataset & Model The dataset consists of hand gesture images representing ASL characters. Data augmentation techniques were applied to improve accuracy. The trained model is excluded from GitHub due to size limitations and can be hosted separately (e.g., Google Drive).

📈 Results Accurate real-time gesture recognition Low latency response Effective translation between sign language and text/speech Works efficiently under normal lighting conditions

⚠️ Limitations Performance may vary under poor lighting Limited to trained ASL gestures Background noise can affect speech recognition accuracy
